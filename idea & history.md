It all started when noticed that animage.tumblr.com hosts most of his images on 3rd party servers instead of the tumblr itself, and that those servers keep the original filenames intact.  
  I found out that he often names the photos in a certain pattern, like (digit)(shortened person name).jpg

This gave me an idea to create a script that would be able to match all the different ways a single name is being shortened (sometimes a nickname was used too) to the name itself.  
  At first the database had multiple records of partial names pointing to a single full name. However probably only a third or a quarter of all images were following this structure, so the use was ratehr limited.
  
  It was at that time that I realized I could use the tags themselves to unambiguously define the names of people on the pictures and more. Although at that time I didn't know about tumblr API yet so I was trying to collect the tags from the page itself. It was trivial when using only a single blog, but when I decided to make it universally applicable, detecting tags in all kinds of different tumblr themes became near impossible.
  
  Fortunately, the discovery of publicly available tumblr API allowed to solve this problem. Still, requesting post info from there requires having the post ID and currently it has to be collected from the page anyway, involving search for the post container regardless of different and often faulty designs. Sometimes the post contents and post meta are in two different containers with separate parent nodes, which further complicates the search. Perhaps I should come up with something even more independent from local designs; something that would figure out which series of post the user is currently viewing and request info from API with the appropriate offset and post amount. Don't really know how to do that now, the address bar contains current page number relative to start, but every tumblr might have individual amout of posts per page, and in case of dashboard it's not applicable at all.
