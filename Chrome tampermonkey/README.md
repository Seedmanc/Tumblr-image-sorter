# Chrome version for Tampermonkey

This version is designed for use with the Tampermonkey userscript engine for Chrome.

## Installation instructions

1. Install [Tampermonkey](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
2. From there create a new script and copy-paste contents of one of the two scripts, overwriting the existing header, then save.
3. Repeat step 3 for the second script too.
4. Go to any tumblr blog or your dashboard and see if the page title is being marked with "â–¶[ " after loading, this indicates that the POST script works.  
  Then trying accessing any image from a photo post with tags and see if the download button appears on the image page, this would indicate that the GET script works as well.

For the rest of configuration, head over to the [main readme section](https://github.com/Seedmanc/Tumblr-image-sorter#usage).

## Version-specific settings

* highlightColor - Since Chrome is incapable of supporting "invert" as a color, which ensured visibility of the saved state of an image in a post regardless of background color, you'll have to select a fixed color and hope it won't blend.
* fixMiddleClick - Because Chrome is so *superior* it launches tumblr photo viewer in photosets even on middle click, instead of opening image in a new tab, as required. This option disables any events bound to onClick event in photosets. It never shows images in full size anyway, useless.
